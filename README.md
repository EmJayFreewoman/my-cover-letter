# About my first project on GitHub
This is my first project on GitHub. I'm a digital marketer/content marketer that has worked in IT for her entire career. I figured it was high time I start to become more technical. Plus, getting laid off isn't fun. I want to improve my knowledge of popular DevOps tools and methodologies.

I'll be uploading files from VS Code to GitHub. Because I'm trying to get some front-end development skills under my belt, I thought I'd play around with HTML and CSS. 
## My process
1. Following freeCodeCamp's core curriculum to earn a couple of verified certifications
2. Apply these new learned concepts to a personal project (i.e - my cover letter, as I'm currently lookign for my next opportunity).
