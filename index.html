      <p><span class="first-letter">H</span>ello World,</p>

      <p>A month ago, I was laid off. My career has traversed many IT landscapes - hardware, software, software testing, and IT architecture. I am excited to see where my path takes me next. One thing's for certain, though, I've been in technology long enough to know I'd like to continue to build my career around it.</p>
        
       <p>I like to understand how systems work. When I understand how their parts interact, as a marketer, I tell more accurate and cohesive stories. My digital marketing career began as a contractor at Lenovo working as an RFP Support Specialist, where I discovered my knack for cross-collaboration and was able to step into my creativity. After a few months of building partnerships across the company, I was able to showcase my writing skills as a copywriter and create unsolicited WFH fliers for the Lenovo Customer Relief Program. These WFH fliers brought in 10 new customers at the start of the pandemic. Unfortunately, as the world started to change, I and other contractors were let go. But this is only the beginnning of my story.
        
        <p>Later that year, I joined the best digital marketing team in the world, Digital Communities, where I had the chance to lead an online technical publication built for IT architects called Enable Architect. Enable Architect was a smaller community that sat alongside three other community-driven open source publications:(formerly) opensource.com, The Enterprisers Project, and Enable Sysadmin.</p>
        
        <p>After almost two and a half wonderful years on the Digital Communities team, and building a strong writer community of at least 200 architect, engineer, and developer writers, seeing over 100,000 monthly readers, my team and I were laid off. Incredibly, I was fortunate enough to be offered another shot at continuing what I started with Enable Architect. I was granted a temporary contract opportunity to support a trusted Enterprise Architect leader from my Enable Architect community as he worked to build a new Enterprise Architect practice across Danaher. A few highlights from my time at Danaher were attending my first kaizen and joining EA practice and infrastructure leaders for a two-day infrastructure planning workshop at Leica Microsystems headquarters in Chicago. I also created a Danaher-wide communications specifically for the new EA practice. It was an incredible learning experience and opened my eyes to areas I could stand to strengthen. 
          
        <p> My next role as Senior Content Marketing Manager at Sauce Labs, my strengths and weaknesses were to put to the test in a new way. In my short time with Sauce Labs, I was able to dive into the captivating world of software testing. While there, I designed landing pages for two major campaigns, including Sauce Labs' first Accessibility Solution Page. I am thankful to have learned so many important skills at once, including blog management, SEO writing, as well as diving deeper into email marketing and demand-gen marketing. Sauce Labs ultimately decided to go into a different direction with their content strategy and I was let go.</p>
        
        <p>But I cannot and will not give up. While I work to find my next opportunity, I aspire to strengthen my breadth of DevOps knowledge and martech strategies. In between applying for jobs you can catch me on Hubspot, playing around on GitHub, or drawing and animating random things on Procreate. On a more personal note, and the reason why you're reading this today, I am studying CSS, HTML, and Javascript through freeCodeCamp. I hope to use this knowledge to enhance my technical acumen and become a more proficient content creator. I also just earned my non-profit management certification from Wayne Community College and hope to start the grant writing process to help fund a small business opportunity in my community.</p> 

        <p>Overall, I'm trying to prepare for my next role. I'm not quite sure what that is yet, but I know I enjoy learning about technology and figuring out unique, out-of-the-box ways to share about complex topics. I am using this gap in employment to upskill and increase my digital literacy to further enhance the way I communicate knowledge to a wide-range of audiences in IT spaces.</p>
      </p>

      <p>If you're interested in learning more about my skills, please don't hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn. Also, check out my GitHub (which is basically empty right now, but hey, it's the thought that counts) to follow my coding journey!</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading,</p>
      <p>Marjorie Freeman</p>
